As a young AI researcher, I'm always excited about bringing cutting-edge AI technology into practical applications. Today, I want to share my latest project: Face Align, an open-source alternative to Apple's Center Stage feature that keeps faces perfectly centered during video calls using AI.

## The Vision Behind Face Align

Have you ever been on a video call where you needed to move around but wanted to stay perfectly framed? That's exactly the problem I set out to solve. Face Align uses advanced AI to track faces in real-time and smoothly adjusts the camera frame to keep you centered - just like Apple's Center Stage, but open-source and customizable.

## Technical Implementation

The project combines several key technologies:

### 1. Face Detection with YOLOv8

At the heart of Face Align is YOLOv8, one of the most efficient object detection models available. I specifically used the YOLOv8-face variant, which is optimized for facial detection. The model provides incredibly fast and accurate face detection, essential for real-time applications.

### 2. Smooth Tracking Algorithm

One of the biggest challenges was creating smooth camera movements. Nobody wants a jittery video feed! I implemented a custom smoothing algorithm that:
- Uses configurable thresholds to prevent micro-adjustments
- Implements asymmetric margins (more space below the face than above)
- Provides smooth transitions between different face positions

### 3. Intelligent Framing

The `ZoomedImage` class implements a sophisticated framing algorithm that considers multiple factors to create the perfect shot:

- **Asymmetric Margins**: Instead of centering faces exactly in the middle, the algorithm adds more space below the face than above it, following professional photography principles for more natural-looking framing.
- **Aspect Ratio Management**: The system automatically adjusts the crop window to maintain the correct aspect ratio for your camera, preventing any stretching or distortion.
- **Edge Case Handling**: When faces approach the edges of the frame, the algorithm intelligently adjusts the crop area to ensure smooth transitions while keeping the subject in frame.
- **Dynamic Resizing**: The frame smoothly adapts to changes in face position while maintaining consistent output dimensions, ensuring compatibility with video conferencing software.

## Key Features

Face Align includes several features that make it particularly useful:

1. **Real-time Processing**: The application processes frames in real-time, making it suitable for live video calls.
2. **Configurable Parameters**: Users can adjust settings like:
   - Margin percentage around faces
   - Smoothing factor for transitions
   - Movement threshold to prevent jitter
3. **Smart Positioning**: The algorithm positions faces slightly above center, which is more aesthetically pleasing for video calls.
4. **Fallback Behavior**: When no face is detected, it smoothly transitions to a full frame view.
